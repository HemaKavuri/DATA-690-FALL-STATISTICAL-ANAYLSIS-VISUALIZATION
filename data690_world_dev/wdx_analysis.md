# Doe's an Educated Society helps in Soical Development


Education develops peoples abilities which is helpful for both individual career development and society's development and to maintain prosperity and compete globalized economy. How does educated socitey helps is social developemnt ? Answer to this question may depends on various factors, it is not a straightforward answer. Education has multiple aims like economic, civic, humanistic and equity promotion. 

## Introduction
In this project we are mainly concentrating on whether child labour rate is discreasing with increase in Literacy rate . As we all know that Child labour is indirectly related to eductaion developement.  Society is nothing but a group of individuals, When an individual got education he/she knows the value of education and does not encourage or involve in child labour directly or indirectly. We can see many childern between age of 15-24 are more likely to work in household works or daily paid labour works. So the countires with high literacy rate should have low child labour rate overall time period.

## Which country is having high Literacy Rate ?

Overall Literacy rate for choosen countires for year 2015 is shown above. The graph says almost all the choosen countries have same literacy rate percentage. It is observed that 14 % of childern under age 15 - 24 are having education. What about remaning 86%, are they involved in child labour which need to be answered future. China, Rusian Federation and Argentina are the countires having high Literacy rate amoung remaning chosen countries.

## What Percentage of children (15-24) age group are involved in child labour?

The above graph says around 60 percentage of children are involved in child labour . Which means 60% of childern age group of 15 - 24 are not having education.
Brazil has highest percentage of child labour involvment, next comes china with 57 percenatge of child labour overall. Where as Turkiye and South Africa has less child labour involved. By this can we relate that countires with high perecentage of child labour rate are having less literacy rate?. The Answer can be yes if yu see the future relation between both in overall time span.

## What about Countires Population?
 
 To decide above two indicators relation we need to know the total population of these countires . From which we can say out of x% percentage of population y% of literacy rate is recorded and z% of Child labour is noted. Which leads to solution to the question we raised before.

This shows China occupies most of the population when comapred to other countries total population and Argentina stood in last place. So China with highest population having highest child labour rate with lowest literacy rate when considering three indicators together.

## What is the Child Labour Rate in Overall Time Span ?

   Above Time series says our previous assumptions are wrong when it comes to Overall Time Span(2010-2020). China's has graduall decrease in child labour rate. But when we observe Argentina's child labour rate it got increased in 2014-2019 and falls in 2020.
   
   ## Overall Literacy Rate

Overall Literacy Rate of China has increased over the time . Rusian has constant Literacy rate throught the time span and South Africa's Literacy rate has decrased in 2017 and raised up to 98 Percentage by 2020. SO from both the Time series plots we can say that Educated Socitey Like china helps in social Devlopment like Eradicating Child Labour .

 This Scatter Plot shows With an Increase in Literacy rate their is a decrease in Child Labour rate in overall Time Span by china.
