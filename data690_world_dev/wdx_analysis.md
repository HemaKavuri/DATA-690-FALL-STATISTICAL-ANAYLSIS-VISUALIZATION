## Introduction
In this project we are mainly concentrating on whether child labour rate is discreasing with increase in Literacy rate . As we all know that Child labour is indirectly related to eductaion developement.  Society is nothing but a group of individuals, When an individual got education he/she knows the value of education and does not encourage or involve in child labour directly or indirectly. We can see many childern between age of 15-24 are more likely to work in household works or daily paid labour works. So the countires with high literacy rate should have low child labour rate overall time period.
