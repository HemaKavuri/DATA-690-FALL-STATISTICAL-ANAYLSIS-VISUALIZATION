# Data Analysis with Python
## Part 1                                                      
### What is Data Analysis?
IT is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transformation and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision - making.
### Data Analysis Tools
- Qlik
- tableau
- looker
- Zoho Analytics
### Programming Languages
- Python 
- R
- julia
### Why Python for Data Analysis ?
- It is very simple and  instinctive to learn
- "Correct" language
- IT uses power langugaes not only for data analyis 
- It is a free and open source language
- amazing community, docs and conferences 
### When to choose R ?
- when R studio is needed
- when we are dealing with more advanced statistical methods
- when extreme performance is needed.
### Data Analysis Process
-  Data Extraction 
-  Data Cleaning
-  Data Wrangling
-  Analysis
-  Action
### We make use of different Libraries.......
 - Pandas
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - seaborn
 - statsmodels
 - scipy
 - scikit-learn
## Part 2
- In part 2 i learnt about how to load the data into jupiter or colab notebook
- I have learn about ploting the results busing box-plot, bar-plot, pie-plot, line-plot
- I also goto know about many inbuilt functions like mean(),median(),value.counts(),unique()
## Part 3
- This part explains about what is a cell and how to do markdown a cell in jupiter/colab notebook
- It tells us how to use Numpy library and how to use Matplotlib for visualization
- I learn about exporting data into excel
## Part 4
- This part says about different arrays and its dimensions and shapes
- How to Indexing and Slicing of Matrices, performining statistics on matrices
-  Useful Numpy functions like random(),rand(),arange(), reshape(), zeros() etc.
## Part 5
-  This speaks about panda Series data, how to indexing the series data 
-  How to modify the series its operations
-  How to handle Dataframes and modify them using different operations are shown
## Part 6
- This explains about missing data using isnan() function or isinf() function
- How to use isnull(), notnull() functions and dropping null values from the dataframe or series using dropna() function
- Finding unique values using unique() function and finding of Duplicates and dropping them using duplicated() and drop_duplicated() functions
## Part 7
- How to read data using Header parameter and column names paramter
- How data type parameter is used while reading data and use of parse_dates parameter
- Usage of data delimiters using sep parameter to store the data seperated by , 
## Part 8
- This part is just an overview of what all we learnt in this tutorial 
- It covers topics about if/else/elif statements and about loops
